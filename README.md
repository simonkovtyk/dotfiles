# About

This repository contains my dotfiles and serves as a centralized configuration baseline. The primary objective is to maintain a high degree of consistency and reproducibility across systems, tools, and environments.

My preferred color is purple. Based on this aesthetic preference, I designed a coherent theming ecosystem named [Dark Orchid](https://github.com/dark-orchid). The ecosystem defines a unified visual identity grounded in purple-based color semantics and is systematically integrated into my dotfiles.
